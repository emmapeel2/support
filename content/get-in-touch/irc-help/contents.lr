title: How can I chat with Tor Project teams?
---
description:

Here is how you can get onto IRC and start to chat with Tor contributors in real time:

1. Enter in [OFTC](https://webchat.oftc.net/) webchat.

2. Fill in the blanks: 

  **NICKNAME:** Anything you want, but choose the same nickname (nick) every time you use IRC to talk to people on Tor. If your nick is already being used, you will get a message from the system and you should choose another nick.

  **CHANNEL:** #tor or others listed at [our contact page](https://www.torproject.org/contact/).
  
3. Click Enter

Congratulations! You're on IRC. 

After a few seconds, you will automatically enter #tor, which is a chatroom with Tor developers, relay operators and other community members. There are some random people in #tor as well.

You can ask questions in the empty bar at the bottom of the screen. Please, don't ask to ask, just ask your question.

People may be able to answer right away, or there may be a bit of a delay (some people are listed on the channel but are away from their keyboards and record channel activities to read later). 

If you want to chat with someone specific, start your comment with their nick and they will typically receive a notification that someone is trying to contact them. 

You should also consider to using an IRC client.

If you cannot enter a channel, please read [this documentation](/get-in-touch/why-i-cant-join-tor-channels/)
